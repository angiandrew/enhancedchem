# How to Submit Your Sitemap to Google Search Console

## Important: Being Logged In ≠ Sitemap Submitted

Just being logged into Google Search Console doesn't mean your sitemap is submitted. You need to actually submit it.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Go to Sitemaps Section
- In Google Search Console, click **"Indexing"** in the left menu
- Click **"Sitemaps"**

### 2. Submit Your Sitemap
- In the "Add a new sitemap" section, you'll see an input field
- The field should show: `https://enhancedchem.com/`
- After that, type: `sitemap.xml`
- **Full URL should be:** `https://enhancedchem.com/sitemap.xml`
- Click the **"SUBMIT"** button

### 3. Verify Submission
- After clicking SUBMIT, you should see your sitemap appear in the "Submitted sitemaps" table below
- Status should show "Success" (may take a few minutes)
- "Discovered pages" should show the number of pages Google found

### 4. Wait for Processing
- Google will process your sitemap within a few hours to a few days
- Check back in 24-48 hours to see the status
- Once processed, Google will start crawling your pages

## Your Sitemap URL
```
https://enhancedchem.com/sitemap.xml
```

## Troubleshooting

**If you see "Couldn't fetch" error:**
- Make sure your site is live and accessible
- Check that `https://enhancedchem.com/sitemap.xml` loads in a browser
- Verify your site is verified in Search Console

**If sitemap shows 0 pages:**
- Check that your sitemap file is generating correctly
- Verify all product URLs are included
- Make sure your site is accessible to Google

## After Submission

1. **Wait 1-2 weeks** for Google to crawl and index your pages
2. **Check "Pages" section** in Search Console to see which pages are indexed
3. **Use "URL Inspection"** tool to test individual product pages
4. **Request indexing** for important pages that aren't showing up
